# bio-vcf

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pjotrp/bioruby-vcf.png)](http://travis-ci.org/pjotrp/bioruby-vcf) 

Yet another VCF parser. This one may give better performance and
useful command line filtering.

The VCF format is commonly used for variant calling between NGS
samples. The fast parser needs to carry some state, recorded for each
file in VcfHeader, which contains the VCF file header. Individual
lines (variant calls) first go through a raw parser returning an array
of fields. Further (lazy) parsing is handled through VcfRecord.

Health warning: Early days, your mileage may vary!

## Installation

```sh
gem install bio-vcf
```

## Quick start

## Command line interface (CLI)

Get the version of the VCF file

```ruby
  bio-vcf -q --eval-once header.version < file.vcf
  4.1
```

Get the column headers

```ruby
  ./bin/bio-vcf -q -eval-once 'header.column_names.join(",")' < test/data/input/somaticsniper.vcf 
  POS,ID,REF,ALT,QUAL,FILTER,INFO,FORMAT,NORMAL,TUMOR
```
